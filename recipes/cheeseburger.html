    <h2><u>How To Make Juicy Burgers:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the beef, oil, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, salt and pepper.</strong> Work through the mixture using your hands until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the burger patties.</strong> Make 1/2 inch-think patties. Make a thumb print in the center of each patty.</li>
        <li><strong>Grill or pan fry.</strong> Preheat your grill over medium-high heat. If you're using the stovetop, preheat a cast iron skillet or grill pan on the stove instead. Cook burgers until browned on the bottom. Flip, add cheese if you want, and cook until done to your liking.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest.</strong> Remove from heat. Let your homemade burgers rest for a few minutes before serving, which lets the juices settle.</li>
    </ol>
