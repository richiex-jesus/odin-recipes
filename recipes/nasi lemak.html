    <h2>Step-by-step instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Make the rice: Stir coconut milk, water, rice, fresh ginger, ground ginger, bay leaf, and salt together in a medium saucepan.</li>
        <li>Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf and keep rice warm until garnish and sauce are ready.</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, make the garnish: Heat 1 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.Stir in peanuts and cook briefly, until lightly browned. Remove peanuts with a slotted spoon and place onto paper towels to soak up excess grease.</li>
        <li>Return the skillet to the stove. Stir in anchovies and cook, turning occasionally, until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on paper towels. Discard oil and wipe out the skillet.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Heat oil in the clean skillet. Stir in onion, shallots, and garlic; cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in chile paste and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally; if mixture is too dry, add water as needed.</li>
        <li>Stir in anchovies and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in tamarind juice, sugar, and salt; simmer until sauce is thick, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Ladle warm rice into bowls. Top with warm sauce, then top with peanuts, fried anchovies, hard-boiled eggs, and cucumber.</li>
