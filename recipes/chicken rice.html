        <li>2 pandan leaves, tied into knots, optional (see notes)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) toasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>

        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic (20g; from 3 cloves)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh peeled ginger (15g; for a 1.5 inch piece)</li>
        <li>2 cups long grain white rice (12.5 ounces; 355g), rinsed well</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><u>For the <em>BOK CHOY:</em></u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons (45 ml) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 medium shallots (2.25 ounces; 64g total), peeled and sliced into 1/16-inch thick rings (about 1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>8 ounces (227g) baby <em><strong>bok choy</strong></em> (6 small heads), washed, trimmed, and halved lengthwise</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><u>For Serving</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 small cucumber (9 ounces; 255g), sliced (2 cups)</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro (4 ounces; 113g), stems and leaves chopped (2 cups)</li>
            <li>Chile garlic sauce</li>
            <li>Kecap manis (sweet soy sauce)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>For the Chicken:</strong> Pat chicken dry and trim excess fat and skin from neck and tail areas; set fat and skin aside for rice. 
            <p>Sprinkle chicken with salt and vigorously rub and massage salt all over chicken to “exfoliate” skin. (Skin should look smooth and be free of any lumps, bumps, or imperfections.</p>
            <p>Take time to exfoliate it well; the better scrubbed the skin is, the better the final texture will be.) Sprinkle with white pepper.</p></li>
        <li>Place chicken, breast-side up, in a large stockpot and add rice wine, soy sauce, ginger, scallions, and pandan leaves (if using). <p>Cover chicken with water by about 1 inch, ensuring that chicken is fully submerged.</p></li>
        <li>Heat over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Cover and reduce heat to low to maintain a bare simmer and poach chicken until breast registers 155°F (68°C) <p>and legs register 165°F (74°C) with an instant-read thermometer (avoiding bone), 25 to 30 minutes (the breast and leg pieces may reach their respective temperatures at different times;</p> make sure to remove each as it is ready). Remove chicken from pot and immediately transfer to a large bowl of ice water. Soak chicken in ice bath until cool, about 10 minutes. <p>Transfer chicken to a plate, gently pat dry, and rub sesame oil all over chicken. Set aside until serving.</p></li>
        <li>Strain broth, discarding solids. Return broth to pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. <p>Boil until reduced to approximately 9 cups (do not skim fat). Season to taste and let cool 15 minutes to allow fat to rise to surface.</p></li>
        <li><strong>For the rice:</strong> In a small saucepan, cook reserved chicken fat and skim trimmings over medium heat, stirring often, until fat begins to render and surface of saucepan is coated in melted fat. <p>Add garlic and giner to cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and lightly golden, 1 to 2 minutes.</p><p>Stir in rice until coated in fat, then remove from heat. Transfer rice mixture to a rice cooker and cover with 3 cups broth</p><p>(using as much fat as possible from broth). Cook rice according to manufacturer's directions.</p></li>
        <li>For the <em><strong>BOK CHOY:</strong></em> In a small saucepan, heat oil and shallots over medium heat, stirring, until deep golden brown, about 10 minutes. <p>Using a slotted spoon, transfer shallots to a small bowl limed with a paper towel.</p></li>
